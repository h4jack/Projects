                    <p>You are going to have real fun here. And, you will gain the ability to do impressive things in
                        life using a computer. It will be like acquiring a superpower to be able to do things that
                        ordinary people cannot do. Let’s see how that is possible.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>A common mobile device, the one you might have in your hands right now, can have 100,000 times
                        more computing power than the computer used to send humans to the moon for the first time. There
                        are 7.7 billion humans; did you know that by 2020 there will be more than 30 billion devices
                        connected to the Internet? Imagine all that power&#8230;&#8203; you could do many unprecedented
                        things with only a little part of it, and that power keeps growing everyday&#8230;&#8203;</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Our world depends on computers. Imagine the apocalyptic catastrophe if computers ceased to work:
                        money in banks is inaccessible, all telecommunications die, airports cease functioning and
                        commercial airliners would fall from the sky, energy distribution systems become uncontrollable,
                        hospitals and critical life support systems would irrevocably fail, and our society would
                        collapse. In 1988, a single person, without bad intentions, took down all the Internet with just
                        one malicious program, known as the Morris Worm. Society was different at that time so it was
                        not as catastrophic as it would have been now. But, why we have not collapsed yet?</p>

                    <p>The only way to overcome a weakness is to first know that it exists. Hackers find weaknesses in
                        the computer world. The word hacker has had several definitions throughout history. In a
                        dictionary, we can find two related definitions:</p>

                <div class="olist arabic">
                    <ol class="arabic">
                        <li>
                            <p>An expert at programming and solving problems with a computer</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A person who illegally gains access to and sometimes tampers with information in a

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>We are going to take a little from both definitions, but we will gain access and tamper with
                        information for good. In other words, a skill can be used for malicious purposes or, to become
                        the real-life hero that manipulates technology at will, keeping the planes in the sky, and
                        society out of collapse. That sounds romantic, but you will realize that just the mere fact of
                        making your computer make something awesome, and getting a secret flag generates emotions and
                        adrenaline. Come with us on this journey to become a real hacker!</p>

                            shell by many names, perhaps sometimes even by the CLI initialism. The GUI
                            doesn&#8217;t have as nice of a name as the shell, so we will probably use GUI to

                            you have not already. Beyond providing 120+ security challenges in helpful

                        <p>A note on the structure of my (LT&#8217;s) chapters: many times I will provide a high
                            level tutorial for a task and also a step by step walkthrough for the same
                            task. This is my attempt at accommodating different learning styles and,
                            different levels of experience. Typically, the high-level walkthrough is more
                            for learners who already know the basics but need a refresher or need a
                            reminder about the particulars when it comes to this Primer. The step by step
                            walkthrough is more for learners who have never ventured in a particular task
                            before. Of course, you must choose your own path here, but the safest bet may
                            be to read the high-level walkthrough but actually put hands to keyboard for
                            the step by step walkthrough.</p>

                            effort on our part. For anyone who has learned a second language, it was quite
                            the opposite: very little - if anything - came naturally. Learning Shell for
                            someone who has only "spoken" GUI is like learning a second language. This is
                            good news and bad news. The good news is that Shell and GUI are languages for
                            something you&#8217;ve been using for probably years, but the bad news is there is a
                            whole new vocabulary with only a handful of cognates (words that sound and mean

                        <p>The main severity in the learning curve with the shell is that you must know
                            the apps and commands available to you either by memorization or by looking
                            them up when you need them. Certainly, it is faster to memorize as many as
                            possible.</p>

                                their learning. I take responsibility for this, and really, most of us go

                            <p>In the shell, pressing the TAB key invokes auto-complete by 1. assuming you&#8217;ve
                                spelled the command or file correctly up to the point of pressing tab, and 2.
                                completing the command or file name as much as it can.</p>

                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>The functionality of auto-complete in the shell is so different from
                                auto-complete in other apps, such as those in a phone, that shell auto-complete
                                is often referred to as tab-complete. It takes some practice to get used to,
                                but it is worth the time as it probably cuts number of key presses in half!</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Unlike auto-complete for a soft keyboard on a phone, tab-complete is never
                                wrong, however, this is mostly because it makes no guesses and only helps with
                                completing commands and file paths and names. It hardly ever helps complete
                                arguments to commands besides file names. If pressing tab doesn&#8217;t do anything,
                                this is either because 1. there is no such command or file name to complete
                                what you&#8217;ve already typed into the command prompt, or 2. there are multiple
                                commands or file names that could complete what you&#8217;ve already typed into the
                                command prompt. Try typing another letter or two. Hit the tab key again. If
                                nothing more is completed, hit tab one more time. If nothing really happens
                                besides an angry noise or flash, then there is no way to complete what you&#8217;ve
                                already typed (maybe there is a typo?), but if the issue is that there are
                                multiple possibilities for tab complete to choose, then these options will
                                display after your second strike on the tab key. The double press of tab can
                                be done at any time, but if there are hundreds of options then the shell will
                                ask for your approval before printing all those options because that&#8217;s not
                                usually very helpful.</p>

# * text listed after &quot;$&quot; I mean for you to enter into the shell and then
#   press enter
# * text listed after &quot;#&quot; are comments from me to you but are ignored by
#   the shell
#
# this short tutorial is meant to run through foundational shell commands
# with brief explanations for each

# the following command &quot;parks&quot; your shell in your home directory (which is
# somewhere you can create files!)

$ cd


# the following command shows where your shell is parked

$ pwd


# the following command creates a new directory called &quot;tutorial&quot; where you
# are currently parked

$ mkdir tutorial


# the following command moves your shell and parks it in the &quot;tutorial&quot; folder
# you just created

$ cd tutorial


# pwd stands for &quot;print working directory&quot;. &quot;working directory&quot; is the
# technical term for where one&#39;s shell is parked

$ pwd


# the following command creates an empty file with the name &quot;note.txt&quot;

$ touch note.txt


# the following command list the contents of your working directory

$ ls


# personally, I prefer a one column output of the contents of my working
# directory, like

$ ls -l


# the following command shows the text content of &quot;note.txt&quot; (which is empty
# right now)

$ cat note.txt


# the following command puts &quot;hello world! I&#39;m a snail&quot; into &quot;note.txt&quot;

$ echo &quot;hello world! I&#39;m a snail&quot; &gt; note.txt


# cat will print something now that there is content in &quot;note.txt&quot;

$ cat note.txt


# the following command makes a copy of &quot;note.txt&quot; called &quot;new-note.txt&quot;

$ cp note.txt new-note.txt


# what is in &quot;new-note.txt&quot;?

$ cat new-note.txt


# * the following command opens &quot;new-note.txt&quot; in a terminal text editor
# * try changing the file, then press Ctrl-X to exit and save

$ nano new-note.txt


# if you were successful, this command should print the new content

$ cat new-note.txt


# if you were not successful, that is just fine. revisit this exercise after
# some more reading and practice!</code></pre>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>In general, computer science professionals refer to "Digital Forensics" as
                            "Forensics", for simplicity&#8217;s sake. Digital Forensics is the field in
                            cybersecurity that tries to gather and understand evidence after an incident,
                            which can be crime, to determine how it happened. This not only helps law
                            enforcement when pledging someone innocent or guilty, but also to understand
                            how to improve security in a system that was successfully attacked. Digital
                            Forensics focuses on gathering evidence present in computer devices that hold
                            information electronically. It is a branch of Forensic Science, which can also
                            investigate any type of crime even if there is not computer media involved.</p>

                            captured in files. There are a few really good GUI tools out there for not
                            just disk analysis, but whole management of digital evidence for cases. Our
                            disk analysis problems will not require any licenses to proprietary software.
                            Some people like to use Autopsy which is a GUI frontend to the tools we will
                            demonstrate how to use in this section. We will use the individual Sleuthkit
                            tools so that you learn a little more than from a GUI that abstracts away some
                            of the details. Disks are all about the details.</p>

                            <p>This challenge requires <code>mmls</code> as a first step to use other Sleuthkit tools,
                                but now is the time for some true forensic background.</p>

                            <p>A disk image is a huge dump of many numbers. But these numbers have an
                                invisible structure to them that gives them much more meaning. Navigating
                                this invisible structure manually is tedious and deeply difficult, but the
                                Sleuthkit tools handle this invisible structure for us. To begin using the
                                Sleuthkit tools we must understand some of the layers that apply to disk
                                images. The four main layers are: media, block, inode, and filename.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="ulist">
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Media: the media layer tools all are prepended with 'mm' and operate on the
                                        disk image with little guidance from the analyst. <code>mmls</code> is a media
                                        layer
                                        tool that gives us the partition table of the image and key information for
                                        delving into the other layers. Media is the lowest level, providing key
                                        information to access the deeper layers, but not shedding much light on the
                                        data contained in the image.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Block: the block layer is the second lowest level of the four layers
                                        considered here. Block layer tools are prepended with 'blk' in the Sleuthkit.
                                        <code>blkcat</code> is a block layer tool that outputs the contents of a single
                                        block. The
                                        block layer is the numbers of the disk image broken into equal-sized chunks. A
                                        single file is likely to contain multiple blocks.

                                    <p>Inode: the inode layer is the bookkeeping layer of a disk image. It&#8217;s
                                        like the table of contents, with the chapter numbers being like the inodes,
                                        and the pages like the blocks of a file. Inode layer tools are prepended with
                                        'i'. <code>icat</code> is an inode layer tool that outputs a single file based
                                        on its
                                        inode number.</p>

                                    <p>Filename: the filename layer is one layer that most any user of a computer
                                        actually sees and interacts with. This is the layer with which we will start
                                        our exploration of the Sleuthkit in the current challenge. Interacting with the
                                        filename layer will look a lot like using the shell normally. Filename layer
                                        tools are prepended by 'f'. <code>fls</code> lists the files on an image
                                        starting at the
                                        root. This is what we will use for our exploration of the disk image.</p>

                                was printed. But now, we want to look at specific directories so we will need
                                their inodes. Helpfully, <code>fls</code> actually prints those along with file and
                                directory names. It&#8217;s the number on the line with each name, if we look back
                                to our listing of '$ fls -o 360448 disk.flag.img' we can find the inode number
                                for <code>/home</code> which is 451. Let&#8217;s add that to our <code>fls</code> call:

                        <p>Another important field of forensics is packet or network analysis. This field
                            of forensics conerns itself with understanding what has happened on a network
                            through the examination of captured packets. This will require the use of a GUI
                            tool called 'Wireshark', which means you cannot use the webshell to complete
                            this problem. The webshell can be used to complete many introductory problems,
                            but more advanced problems sometimes need a GUI tool to be solved in an
                            efficient manner. Consider this an exercise in installing and using GUI tools.

                            <p>Remember, your flag might be different than mine. It would be good to notice
                                that there was something different about the packet with the flag from the
                                beginning. It has a protocol of 'S101', and it&#8217;s the only one. Such glaring
                                oddities should always be examined. Sometimes, the only clue in a packet
                                analysis problem is a small difference between the flag packet and the rest of
                                the thousands of packets. A good strategy is to filter as many packets as you
                                can, then look for oddities. I should note also that there is not always a
                                'flag packet'. Sometimes a flag can span across multiple packets, just like
                                packet payloads can span across multiple packets.</p>

                            <p>We&#8217;ll now cover some background to deepen your understanding of packets and
                                networks. The networks we commonly use today, are broken down into different
                                layers. This design by layers assigns responsibilities to each layer to
                                accomplish something. It is good to have a design by layers for several
                                reasons. For example, if network engineers want to make a change in one of the
                                layers, the impact on the other layers is minimized. Another example, is that
                                if you are a programmer and want to connect your application with a server, you
                                do not necessarily need to care if the user is using wifi or ethernet cable, or
                                how the user is connecting to the internet. Your application can simply trust
                                other layers are going to take care of that and your application will have a
                                successful connection. These are the layers, viewed in a top down approach.</p>

                                        applications. HTTP belongs to this layer; HTTP protocol is commonly used to
                                        obtain Web Pages. In the Packets Primer capture, click the fourth packet. This

                                    <p>Transport layer: Responsible for providing several connections on the same
                                        host, that means that you can have several applications on the same device and
                                        each of them can have a different connection even if it is just one device. It
                                        also defines functionalities for reliable transport. Two protocols are used on
                                        this layer. TCP (Transport Control Protocol). You use this protocol when you
                                        need to have reliable transport, this makes sure that if a piece of information
                                        was missing while being transfertransferred it is resent. HTTP from the
                                        Application layer, runs on top of TCP, because when you visit a Web Page you
                                        want to have every part of it accurately. On the other hand, when you don’t
                                        need reliable transport, but you want faster transport that does not resend
                                        parts that were missing, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is used. An example when
                                        UDP is needed is for voice communication. When you are talking if a little part
                                        of the audio is missing, you do not want it to appear later in the
                                        communication because that would confuse the listener. The listener can still
                                        understand what you are saying if the part missing is small enough. Since UDP
                                        has no controls for transport, it is faster than TCP. This layer assigns a port
                                        to each connection, and that is how it tells the difference between connections
                                        in the same computer, because of the port.</p>

                                    <p>Network layer: It provides devices with an address in the network called the
                                        IP (Internet Protocol) address, and routes information through different
                                        routers. It provides mapping between all the computers connected to the
                                        internet. When you connect to a network in some specific place, an IP is
                                        assigned to your device.</p>

                                    <p>Data link layer: It provides communication between devices that are connected
                                        directly. Examples of protocols in the data link layer are Ethernet or WiFi.
                                        You generally use WiFi to send messages to your router directly without any
                                        other devices in between. Each device has a physical address in wifi or
                                        ethernet, known as the mac address. The mac address is used for this layer.
                                        This is not an address like the IP that can change depending on the network you
                                        are connected to. The mac address is assigned to the hardware of your network
                                        card when it is manufactured.</p>

                    <p>A computer program is a set of instructions that allow us to do a task
                        automatically on a computer. We can make a computer program in a programming
                        language. Computer programs are generally called "software". With a computer
                        program we can do all sorts of things. Some examples are calculators, video
                        games, text processors, browsers, and all the things you have ever used in a
                        computer. Nowadays, there are computers everywhere. Any device such as a cell
                        phone, smart watch, or modern car is running software that was made in
                        programming. To begin, we are going to learn python, which is one of the
                        easiest programming languages to learn.</p>

                        independently. For that, you could read the python documentation, which is

                        are a good start to begin to write your own programs to exploit software. We do
                        this by making examples that achieve one objective and we explain how they work
                        along the way. This will allow you to read code written by someone else, of
                        course, with the help of google if they use elements that you did not know

                    <p>Python, as any other programming language, has variables. A variable can hold
                        different types of data. What we just printed on the screen was a string of
                        characters. When we enclose something in quotes, we are telling python it is a
                        string of characters. A string is a data type. In python, to create a variable
                        we simply choose a name and assign the value that we want. For example, we are
                        going to create a variable called my_string, and we are going to assign to that
                        variable the value "Hello World!":</p>

                        python programming, the symbol = is used to assign the value from the right
                        side of the equal to the variable at the left side. Variables can have any name
                        we like, except some specific words that are reserved for python instructions.
                        For example, the word 'print' is reserved, so you cannot use it as a variable

                    <p>We have introduced the concept of a python loop. The word 'for' is used to
                        declare a 'for loop', which is a loop that iterates in a range of numbers. The
                        'i' next to 'for', is a variable that will be incremented on each iteration on
                        a range of 20. We can change the range for a bigger one or a smaller one by
                        changing the number inside the parenthesis. Note that a line of code will be
                        inside the loop, if it is indented by four spaces. For example, run this:</p>

                        spaces, as we said. Once we use a line of code that is not indented for the
                        first time after the loop, that is considered the end of the loop. If you try
                        to indent a line after the loop has finished, like this:</p>

                    <p>So far, we have seen how a computer can repeat an instruction several times,
                        which is something fundamental in a computer. We want computers to do
                        repetitive tasks for us. Another fundamental functionality we want in computers
                        is conditional clauses. A conditional clause means that a program will do an
                        action only if a condition is met or take another path if the condition is not
                        met. For example, suppose you are printing the numbers from 0 to 9, and you
                        want to print a message when the number is less than 5 and another message when
                        the number is equal or greater than 5. You would do it in the following manner:</p>

                        <p>If you have a piece of code that you want to use often, copy pasting that piece
                            of code is a bad idea because your code gets longer and for a human becomes
                            harder to read. On the other hand, if you want to make a modification in that
                            piece of code, you will have to modify every part in which you copy and pasted
                            that code. We can overcome that by using functions. A function can receive
                            parameters, which are variables you pass to the function so operations with
                            them can be done. Additionally, a function can return a value, which is the
                            result after all the operations are done. Let’s see an example of a function
                            that verifies if a number is even or odd. If it is even, it will return True.
                            If it is odd, it will return False. The program receives any number you input
                            and verifies such an input. Note that the '%' operator in the code is the
                            modulo operator, which calculates the remainder. In this case we calculate the
                            remainder of x divided by 2 and compare that to zero to determine if the number
                            is even or odd. Read the code to understand!</p>

                        <p>A program might need to have interactions with a user. For example, a
                            calculator expects that the user enters some numbers to then do the processing.
                            Receiving user input in a terminal is very easy in python because it has
                            predefined functions that do it for us. The function ‘input()’ waits until the
                            user writes something in the terminal and presses enter. Note that a function
                            can have zero parameters. Then, the function returns the string that the user
                            wrote, and we assign it to the variable number_iterations’. Here is an example,
                            in which we allow the user to control the number of iterations of our program:</p>

                        <p>As you saw, this program reads a file and enumerates each line in the output.
                            The 'open' function has two parameters, the first one is the path of the file
                            you want to open, and the second has a string with the letter 'r', which means
                            that we want to <strong>r</strong>ead the file. 'my_file' is just the name of the file we
                            want to read. Then, we can iterate over each of the lines of the file in a for
                            loop.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Note that this is all made inside a 'with' block. We use the 'with' statement
                            before opening a file to close the file automatically after reading. Also, to
                            handle possible exceptions during the execution. What that means is that when
                            you open a file, you must close it and make sure that it closes correctly. For
                            example, if you do my_file.close(), that would close the file. Imagine that
                            along the way before calling close, something happens and you never get to the
                            line in which you close the file, so you left it open accidentally. Later we
                            will give you more details on exceptions. For the time being, just think of
                            'with' as an easy way to ensure that the file will be closed correctly.</p>

                            the integer to string, otherwise python will show an error. To concatenate
                            strings, we use the operator '+'. When we add two strings, python will
                            concatenate them. When we add two integers, python will do a mathematical
                            addition. To represent a break of line in a string, we use "\n".</p>

                            the string after it writes it, so we would have a file with a single huge line

                        <p>It is a good practice to explain what your code is doing in a comment. In that
                            way, the reader of the code, which may be yourself, will understand what some
                            part of the code is doing. You will realize that when you write some code, you
                            will forget the exact logic and you will have to read it again to understand
                            what you did. In summary, comments are something very important in programming.
                            In python, you write a comment by adding the '#' symbol at the beginning of any
                            line of your code. This line, will be ignored by the python interpreter as it
                            did not exist, so it does nothing in the program. See the following example:</p>

                            cannot be done for some other reason, an exception is thrown. For example, if

                        <p>The decimal base is the one we use in everyday life, which likely comes from
                            the fact that humans have 10 fingers. Therefore, we have 10 different symbols
                            to represent all different numbers. In computers, it is helpful to have a base
                            with 16 symbols because it translates easier to binary. You probably know that
                            most computers physically store only binary numbers, which are represented only
                            by 0 and 1. A <strong>b</strong>inary dig<strong>it</strong> is called a bit. Although
                            computers use

                        <p>Before diving into Web Exploits, you need to understand how a website works. Many years ago,
                            the web was used to visit static pages that did not have interactive features; they just
                            showed information. To do a static page, it is enough to write some lines of HTML. What is
                            HTML? First, it is not a programming language. Html means HyperText Markup Language, and we
                            use it to determine the font size, colors, margins, or similar features in a web page. When
                            an html file is accessed in a browser like Firefox, Chrome or whichever browser you like,
                            the browser presents the text according to the html on it. Your browser can access an html
                            file locally. Locally means that the file could be in your laptop or file system. In
                            contrast, it could access the file remotely through the Internet. Let&#8217;s see an example
                            of creating a simple html and access it locally:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="olist arabic">
                        <ol class="arabic">
                            <li>
                                <p>On your computer, create a folder called "picoexample" and then, inside that folder,
                                    create a text file and name it "myFirstPage.html". You can do this on Notepad on
                                    Windows, Textedit on Mac, or any text editor from Linux. It is important that the
                                    extension is ".html". It cannot be ".html.txt" or something that is not exactly
                                    ".html". If you don&#8217;t see the extension in your operating system, this is a
                                    good opportunity to google how to make it appear to be able to modify it. Remember,
                                    for obstacles that might appear along the way, google is the answer.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Edit the content in a text editor and write: Hello World!</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Save the file</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Open the file in any browser. To do that, you can right click on the file, and then
                                    select "open with" and choose the browser you want. You should see a page like the
                                    following:</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                                <p>Now, in the text editor, modify the content of the file and replace the text by:
                                    &lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;/b&gt;</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Save the file on the text editor. Then, open the file in the browser again, or you
                                    can simply click refresh on your browser. Since it already has opened the file, you
                                    will see the message in bold, similar to this:</p>
                            </li>

                            that &lt;b&gt; is the opening tag, &lt;/b&gt; is the closing tag. Analyze the difference
                            between the opening and closing tag. What do you see? The closing tag is usually the same as
                            the opening tag, but you include "/" like we just did. We just used an html tag to tell the
                            browser we want some specific text in bold. Html is just a bunch of tags that allow us to do
                            similar things.</p>

                                    experiment of removing it. If you only remove the opening or closing tag it will
                                    cause an html error, so make sure to delete the opening tag and closing tag.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>First you see there is not opening or closing tag, there is just one tag with the slash at
                            the right-hand side. This is ok for an image. As you can see, it has an
                            <strong>attribute</strong> called "src", which means source. We are assigning to "src" the
                            value "picologo.png". Our html is going to try to access a file called "picologo.png" in the
                            same folder where "myFirstPage.html" is contained, which is the folder we name at first
                            "picoexample". There is no image called "picologo.png", so the browser has nothing to show.
                            Copy and paste an image to the folder and name it "picologo.png". The extension of the image
                            has to be ".png". If you have an image with a different extension, you can just use the
                            extension you need in the "src" attribute in your html. For example, if the extension of the
                            image you have is ".jpg" you can simply replace
                        </p>

                        <p>To make pages more interactive JavaScript is commonly used. JavaScript is a programming
                            language! We can do algorithms using it. JavaScript is executed in your browser. For
                            example, when you visit a website, the JavaScript code is downloaded along the HTML and it
                            only executes once it is loaded in your browser. When you visit a page, you are downloading
                            an html file and your browser interprets the tags and prints the text and images as we
                            learned before. This image illustrates that process:</p>

                            Website, your user and password has to be verified on the server. The password is stored in
                            the server and should not travel outside of it for the sake of security. If you would verify
                            a password on JavaScript, you would be able to see it on your browser in the same way you
                            can see any JavaScript, and that would be very insecure. There are several programming

                            deploy. In any case, as a hacker, you would generally have to learn all the languages you
                            can because different websites are made on different languages, as well as CTF challenges

                            happen in any programming language, because they are not a fault of the language, but a
                            fault of the programmer that did the website.</p>

                        <p>After you Login into a Website, the website needs a way to know that any request coming from
                            your browser is coming from a user that previously logged in, without the need to send the
                            user-password again. To do that, the website can send to your browser a secret random value
                            after login. That value is generally stored in a cookie or in JavaScript local storage. For
                            this example, let&#8217;s pretend it is stored in a cookie, which is simply a variable in
                            your browser that can retain data. If a Website sets a specific cookie in your browser, your
                            browser automatically re-sends that cookie in each request to the website. If a website only
                            uses cookies to retain a session, and if a hacker can steal the authentication cookie from
                            you, they could pretend to be you! Note that only using cookies for authentication will open
                            the possibility of Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), but this will be explained later, for

                            will try to print your name, but your name is actually JavaScript code, so the browser might
                            execute that JavaScript code. In that way, you could execute your own JavaScript on your

                            storage after a user logs in. At that point, your friend&#8217;s account would probably be

                        <p>A library is a set of functions that allow us to do some actions in an easier manner. In this
                            case, it allow us to do requests and send data from JavaScript to a server. We are just
                            sending the cookie to a remote service that is made to receive cookies from this exercise.
                            That service receives two variables: "cookie" and "hackername". The value of the variable
                            cookie will be "document.cookie". Here, instead of "=", we use ":" to assign a value to a
                            variable. Using document.cookie you access the cookies from JavaScript, so that should
                            contain the cookie you want to steal. The variable hackername simply has a name assigned.
                            You could replace the string "YourName" with your actual name. Remember that a string must
                            be inside quotes in JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>Cryptography is an ancient field that dates to Ancient Rome. Etymologically, the word traces back
                        to the Greek roots "kryptos" meaning "hidden" and "graphein" meaning "to write." It is used to
                        communicate secretly in the presence of an enemy. With cryptography we can achieve the following
                        properties when a message is sent:</p>

                    <p>First, we will see how to achieve Confidentiality. This is done with encryption. When we want to
                        hide a message, we say that we encrypt the message. To understand how encryption works, we will
                        see an example of an ancient way of encrypting a message that is not secure by any means today,
                        but it is good for illustration. But first, to practice our terminal skills, we will encrypt a
                        folder in linux to prevent anyone from reading its contents without the appropriate password.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>"Cipher" means a secret or disguised way of writing a message. It can be thought as the same
                            as encryption. One cipher method invented in the antique Rome and named after the emperor
                            Julius Caesar who used it for his private communication is Caesar&#8217;s cipher. This
                            cipher simply substitutes each of the letters of a word by another one that is a certain
                            number of positions further in the alphabet. That "certain number of positions" is called
                            the shift. For example, if we have the word "hello" and we want to encrypt it using
                            Caesar&#8217;s cipher with a shift of 3, we would replace the 'h' by 'k' because 'k' is 3
                            positions further in the alphabet, the 'e' by 'h' for the same reason, and so on. We called
                            the original text we want to encrypt the cleartext or plaintext. The result of encrypting
                            'hello' using Caesar&#8217;s with a shift of 3, is the following:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>cleartext &#8594; h e l l o</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>"Decrypting" means obtaining the clear text from the encrypted text. For Caesar&#8217;s
                            cipher we simply do the same but in reverse; we subtract 3 positions in the alphabet to each
                            letter.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Note that when we get to the end of the alphabet after adding positions while encrypting
                            something, we simply overlap the alphabet. For example, to encrypt the letter 'z', we would
                            encrypt it using the letter 'c'.</p>

                            replace a letter by another letter. You can use any symbol if you know how to reverse it.

                        <p>Read the comments in the python source code to understand it. You probably noted the '%',
                            which is called the modulo operator. That allows us to wrap around a number, because it
                            calculates the remainder of the division. We will see more detail of this in the future, so
                            do not worry too much about it for now. But, know that if we want a number to start from 0
                            again if it surpasses certain threshold, we can use modulo operator. In this case, we use it
                            because we only have 26 letters in the english alphabet. So, the first position is 0, which
                            contains 'a', because arrays start at zero. The last position is 25, which contains 'z'. So,
                            if we want to encrypt 'z', we would need to add 3 positions, and 25+3 is 28, but after 25 we
                            need to begin from 0 again because of the way that caesar works. Modulo operator works
                            perfect for that because:</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>27%26 is 1</p>

                        <p>So, as we said before in an example, the letter 'z' would be encrypted with 'c', which is in
                            the position 2 considering that arrays start at 0. Other thing that you maybe did not
                            understand at once from the code, was that we subtracted 97 from the ASCII value. Go to:</p>

                            but instead applying the modulo on 123, like in the following code:</p>

                            doing transpositions in chunks of 6 letters using the following mapping:</p>

                        <p>There is a principle in cryptography called the Kerckhoffs&#8217;s principle that states: "A

                            is known by the enemy the encryption is broken. The solution is to use a key. One old
                            algorithm that was used to encrypt data using a key was "Vigenere". It looks certainly

                        <p>In modern cryptography exist the concept of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric
                            cryptography means that you use the same key for encryption and decryption like we just did
                            on Vigenere. In asymmetric cryptography you have two keys. One is for encryption, known as
                            the public key, the other one is for decryption, known as the private key. Asymmetric
                            cryptography is useful because it can be used to solve the problem of a key exchange.
                            Additionally, it can be applied for digital signatures that provide integrity and
                            non-repudiation.</p>

                            <p>A commonly used algorithm today for symmetric cryptography, is AES, which means "Advanced
                                Encryption Standard". This algorithm has a combination of substitutions and
                                transpositions using a key of fixed length. A key of fixed length means that the
                                algorithm can only have a key with a certain size. However, AES has different versions
                                and each version can support a key length of different sizes. The most common versions
                                are AES 128 and AES 256, which have a key length of 128 bits and AES 256 respectively.
                                AES algorithm is considered secure. However, the implementation can be attacked
                                successfully if it has flaws. For example, one famous way to break AES encryption is the
                                Padding Oracle Attack, which allows to successfully crack SSL, an encrypted protocol
                                that was widely used to secure HTTP traffic. However, this is not a weakness of AES, but
                                a weakness in how it is used.</p>

                                    AES 128, we break the clear text in chunks of 128 bits and use AES to encrypt them
                                    independently. This causes a problem because it leaks structure in the encrypted

                                    In other cases, this operation mode can be very bad for other reasons. Suppose you
                                    are sending an encrypted text and you know that the first 128 bits contain a name
                                    and the second 128 bits contain a date. Imagine that you are an attacker that
                                    captures some encrypted messages on different dates. Even if you do not know the
                                    key, you could be able to interchange the second block of messages to tamper the
                                    date. To understand this better let&#8217;s look at an example. Suppose you
                                    intercept a message sent on May 1, and after some days you intercept another message
                                    in on May 8.</p>

                                <p>Imagine you want to make the receiver think that the second message is from May 1.
                                    You could simply replace the blue block by the red block.</p>

                                <p>Another problem of ECB is that if you send the same message twice, any attacker can
                                    see that the same message is being sent again. A secure encryption algorithm should
                                    not leak any information about the message. Knowing that the same message was sent
                                    in the past can be used to learn details about the communication. It is recommended

                                <p>A more secure operation mode is CBC, which means Cipher Block Chaining. In this mode
                                    we include additional elements. The first one is the initialization vector, a random
                                    value with the same size as the key. In AES, the key size is the same as the block
                                    size. Remember that in AES we must separate the cleartext in blocks with the same
                                    size as the key. Before starting the encryption, we do XOR between the first block
                                    of cleartext and the Initialization Vector, then we begin to encrypt using AES with
                                    the key of our choice. The initialization vector is different for every message, so
                                    if we send the same message twice, it will be different due to the initialization
                                    vector. We must attach the initialization vector to the message. Another element we
                                    add in this operation mode, is that we do not encrypt blocks independently, but we
                                    use the encrypted text from one block and XOR it with the next block of cleartext we
                                    want to encrypt. Then, we use AES and the key to encrypt that result. In the

                                <p>In AES, the cleartext must be the same size as a multiple of the block size. For
                                    example, if you have a cleartext that happens to be shorter than a block, you need
                                    to add padding to the cleartext so it matches at least one block. In a case where
                                    cleartext is larger than one block, but smaller than two, you need to add padding to
                                    the cleartext until it is the same size as two blocks. In AES there is a common way
                                    of padding, which is a standard called PKCS #7. In AES 128, as we said previously,
                                    the block size is 128 bits, which is equivalent to 16 bytes. Suppose you want to

                            <p>Remember that asymmetric crypto, means that we use one key for encrypting (the public
                                key) and another key for decrypting (the private key). Suppose you want to communicate
                                secretly with asymmetric crypto. In that case, you generate a public and private key
                                pair. Then, give the public key to anyone that wants to send you an encrypted message.
                                They will encrypt the message using your public key and when you receive the encrypted
                                message, you are the only one that can decrypt it, because you are the only one that has
                                the private key. That&#8217;s why it is called "private". Note that your public key can
                                be of public knowledge and no one would be able to decrypt the message. If you want to
                                send an encrypted message to someone, that person would have to give you their public

                            <p>A very widely used algorithm for asymmetric cryptography is RSA. It is called RSA because
                                of its inventors: Ronald <strong>R</strong>ivest, Adi <strong>S</strong>hamir, and
                                Leonard <strong>A</strong>dleman. To understand how it works, we will encrypt and
                                decrypt using RSA algorithm with a public-private key pair that was generated for this
                                example; it will seem a bit magical. After that, we will understand some concepts, learn
                                to generate keys, and encrypt and decrypt with the generated keys.</p>

                            <p>Before encrypting, you need to understand how it works the modulo operation if you do not
                                know already. It is actually very simple. The modulo operation finds the remainder after
                                division of one number by another. For example, 8 mod 3 = 2, because 3 fits in 8 two
                                times, and we have a reminder of 2. Since RSA uses very basic arithmetic, we are ready
                                to see the example. In RSA, the public key is a pair of numbers, as well as the private
                                key. The message can be anything that we can represent as a number. In a computer,
                                everything is a number as we know. The encrypted text, also called ciphertext, will be
                                another number. In summary, this what we need in RSA to encrypt and decrypt:</p>

                                key. As you just saw, the formulas are very simple. To encrypt a message, you simply
                                take the message to the power of 'e', and then do modulo 'n'. To decrypt, take the
                                ciphertext to the power of 'd', and then do modulo 'n', and that would result in the
                                original message. In this example the numbers of the keys are very small, which is
                                insecure in real life. RSA is only secure when large values are used. By 2019, RSA is
                                considered secure only if the key is a number that would take at least 2048 bits. Which

                                need to understand some parts of it to show our attack. Note that "In number theory, two

                                written co-prime) if the only positive integer (factor) that divides both of them is 1.
                                Consequently, any prime number that divides one does not divide the other. This is

                                we use to multiply another number, and obtain 1 as a result. For example, in non-integer

                                1/8, Because 8 * 1/8=1. However, in integer arithmetic we don&#8217;t have fractions.
                                But we can have a multiplicative inverse modulo n, which means that if we have a number,
                                multiply it by its multiplicative inverse, and take modulo n, the result will be 1.</p>

                                <p>RSA can be easily broken if it has a small 'n'. This does not happen often in real
                                    life, unless a programmer decides to implement their own version of RSA. A
                                    programmer should not make their own implementations of cryptography, it is a
                                    general rule to use libraries tested by industry. The security of RSA is based on
                                    the fact that there is not an efficient algorithm to factorize a large 'n', so an
                                    attacker is not able to generate the private key from the public key. In case 'n' is
                                    too small, it is possible to factorize it.</p>

                                    In real life, the public key comes in a digital certificate, which is a package that
                                    contains data related to the owner of the public key along with the public key
                                    itself. Digital certificates are often encoded in base64, which is a way of encoding
                                    a binary as a printable text. The following is an example of a digital certificate

                            <p>Imagine you want to download a big file from the internet. However, after downloading,
                                you want to check that every bit of the file is correct, and nothing was changed because
                                of a transmission error or a malicious attacker. To do this, you can use a hash, which
                                is a value that you get after applying a hash function to the file, and you obtain a
                                string of fixed length that identifies that file. Whenever you apply the hash function
                                to the file, you will get exactly the same hash, unless the file has been modified. If
                                one bit of the file was changed, you would get a very different hash. So, using a hash
                                we can check the integrity.</p>

                                not have access to the place in which the hash is stored, because in that case, the
                                attacker would be able to modify the file, recalculate the hash, and replaced the stored
                                hash, so we would not be able to tell that the file was modified.</p>

                            <p>Hashes are commonly used to store passwords in a database. When a user logs in, the hash
                                of the password is calculated, and it is compared with the hash stored. If they match,
                                we know that the user input the correct password. Note that a fundamental property of
                                hashes is that it is impossible to get the original text from the hash. Because of this,
                                a system administrator would not be able to learn the actual password of users if they
                                have access to the database. In the case of a data breach, when a database is leaked,
                                attackers would not be able to obtain the real password of users.</p>

                            <p>How can a hash be attacked? In the case of passwords, an attacker can create a table that
                                maps several passwords to their hash by calculating the hash of several words, for
                                example all the words in an english dictionary. In that way, if the attacker finds a
                                hash of the password in the database, and the password was a word present in an english
                                dictionary, it could be possible to map it back to the original password by looking for
                                it in the table. However, if a user picked a secure password, this attack would not work
                                because that secure password with complexity, would not be in a dictionary. Note there
                                are lists of commonly used passwords which contain words in several languages and
                                modifications of them, for example, "Hello_12345". A secure password should be random
                                characters to prevent this attack.</p>

                        protocols. A Protocol is a set of rules that allow two computers in a network to send and
                        receive information. That set of rules is essential to understand what information is coming
                        from what source, or how to send information to a particular computer in the network. To sniff
                        traffic in a network, we will be using a tool called Wireshark, which can show the packets
                        transmitted on a network and we can get passwords from insecure connections. But first, we will
                        briefly explain some important things so you roughly understand the composition of a packet and

                        if you download a big file, you can see that it takes some time. This happens because the file
                        is broken down into packets that are received in your computer, and begin to accumulate, until
                        they are all received and conform the whole file when the download is completed. Each packet

                        <p>Now come back to the Wireshark window. What we want to do now is finding the packets that
                            were sent and received in your computer when you accessed the link. If there are too many
                            packets from all the connections on your computer, this task would be too hard task without
                            the help of a Wireshark filter. A Wireshark filter allows you to tell Wireshark that you
                            only want to see some specific packets. You can filter by protocol, IP, strings present in
                            your request, or anything you need that helps you find what you are looking for faster. When
                            we accessed the link on the browser, we did an HTTP request. We can filter HTTP requests, by
                            simply typing http on the filter textfield and pressing enter. The following image shows the
                            results and we circled in red the textfield in which you have to type:</p>

                        <p>Right below the textfield in which you typed is the packet list. We can see two packets. The
                            first one is the request your browser sent to the server asking for the web page, so
                            naturally it has your IP as the source, and the IP of the server as the destination. The
                            second packet is the reply, which now has your IP as the destination and the IP of the
                            server as the source because now the server is the one that is sending the page to you after
                            you request it.</p>

                            explained previously of the currently selected packet. Now, we will send a user and password
                            to the web site. This page in particular does not do anything after you send a password, it
                            just receives it, but the important thing is to note that we can see the password on
                            wireshark when we send it. In the web page, type the following in user and password
                            respectively:</p>

                        <p>In Wireshark, you should see now two more packets, one in which you send the user and
                            password, and the reply of the server. Note that the reply of the server is the same page,
                            as we said this page does nothing. So far, we have 4 packets, and the third one is the one

                        <p>We just found the password we sent using sniffing. A fundamental thing to note, is that we
                            were able to do that because the website was using HTTP, instead of HTTPS which is
                            encrypted. Encryption prevents us from understanding the contents of a packet.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, we are always able to sniff the network card of our own computer. However, if
                            we want to sniff packets from other devices connected to the same WIFI, we must do
                            additional things because WiFi could be using encryption. We encourage you to use a second
                            device, it can be a smartphone, to access the web page and send a password. Then in your
                            computer use Wireshark to capture the password sent, but first you need to do two things:

                        <p>SQL is used to create and manipulate a very common type of databases called relational
                            databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. With it you can create tables in a
                            database, store data on them, and run different queries that let you extract and analyze
                            data. We are going to see some examples in a relational database management system (RDBMS)
                            called MySQL. Once you learn the basics of SQL in any RDBMS, it is easy to apply them in
                            others. We are going to see a very quick introduction so you are able to understand the

                        <p>We can execute MySQL statements online. So, let&#8217;s create our table from the previous
                            example on it. First, delete the code present in the editor. You should be seeing something
                            like this:</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="title">Figure 40. Online MySQL engine</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Now, you can create the table using the following statement:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>create table user (id integer, name text, lastname text, phone text, password text);</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Analyze the statement carefully. This statement creates a table called "user" with five
                            columns. The first column is "id", and has the data type int, which means integer. The other
                            columns are "name", "lastname", "phone", and "password", which are of datatype text. In
                            datatype integer, as you might guess, you can only store integers. In a datatype text, you
                            can store strings. Put that statement in the SQL editor and hit the button "Run". If it was
                            successful, you will see a green bar on top of the editor with the label "success". When you
                            create tables in SQL, they are stored and become available to insert future data on them.
                            However, in this online editor tables just survive in a single run, so in the same script we
                            will have to create the table, insert the data, and query the data.</p>

                        <p>So far we have created the table but it is empty. To insert a row, add the following

                            look like this:</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>The objective of the basic SQL injection we are learning is to try to inject an "or"
                            expression that is always true. In that way the server code constructs a query using the
                            user input that deceives the program into it returning the whole table. That happens when a
                            program is concatenating strings to construct a query in the server code. The following is
                            an example in PHP:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">

                                password='</span>".$password.""<span class="lime">';</span>"</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>The green part of the query will be concatenated with the value of the variables to form the
                            final query. Let&#8217;s suppose that $name is equal to "samuel", and $password is equal to
                            "hello", the query would result in</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>SELECT * FROM user where name='samuel' and password='hello';</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>What would happen if the password contains a single quote? That might break the syntax of the
                            SQL query. Even worse, it could be used to inject your own sql. For example, if the value of
                            $password is:</p>

                            application did not show us those records. That&#8217;s why it is called Blind SQL
                            injection. We can inject SQL, but we cannot see the result!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>What can we do about this? We will try to inject a SQL to guess one character of a field at a
                            time. Suppose we want to guess the first character of the password. If we don&#8217;t guess
                            it, the application will return "NOTHING FOUND". If we guess it, it will return "REGISTER
                            FOUND".</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Note, this is fundamental to be able to guess only one character at a time. Trying to guess a
                            whole string at the same time, is much harder. Suppose a word is made up by a combination of
                            the 26 characters of the alphabet. To guess only the first letter, we only have to try 26
                            values. However, if we try to guess the whole word, is much more complicated. To illustrate
                            this, suppose we have a word of two letters. If we can guess one at a time, we will need at
                            most 26 trials for the first one, and 26 trials for the second one, for a total of 52
                            trials. On the other hand, if we try to guess both letters at a time, we will need 26*26
                            trials, which is 626 trials, because they can have different combinations. If we add more
                            characters, guessing the whole word becomes much harder because it would emerge too many
                            possible words. Nonetheless, guessing one letter at a time, will keep being only 26 trials
                            for each letter. The blind SQL injection is based on that fact, it will try to inject a
                            query that only compares one character at a time.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>To be able to do that, you need to know the name of the column you are trying to guess. This
                            is not that hard, because in many cases you can infer the name of the database column based
                            on the name of the html input. In other cases, you can leak the name if an error occurs
                            inside the application, and in the error message the application shows the value of the
                            columns.</p>

                            want to get the password from that user. To narrow down the query to the row in which the
                            user 'picoctf' information is stored, you could use:</p>

                            script that does the job for us. Suppose we found the name of the table in some way. The

                    <p>We could say that C is one of the oldest programming languages that is still widely used in
                        industry. It was developed in 1972 by the famous Dennis Ritchie, and even after all these years,
                        is in fact one of the most used languages. This is the case because it is very efficient and we
                        can control very directly the resources of the machine, in contrast to other languages, such as
                        python. However, it is a more difficult language to learn to use it correctly, and it is much
                        more prone to errors and vulnerabilities. Even experienced programmers that have written a lot
                        of C in their lives can make a little mistake and introduce a bad vulnerability in a program
                        that a hacker can exploit to take complete control of the machine in which the program is
                        running.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Nonetheless, many people still love C. We can use it to implement programs that need to be very
                        efficient, such as the Operating Systems, Drivers (the programs that control the hardware of
                        devices that we connect to our computer), or Embedded Systems. You will probably not hear about
                        an Operating System, or a Driver, fully implemented on python, at least any time soon.</p>

                                <p>C is very prompt to vulnerabilities, as we already mentioned. We will learn to
                                    exploit those vulnerabilities. C is harder to learn and write than python, because
                                    you need to clearly understand how the memory interacts with your program.</p>

                                <p>You can compile C for different platforms. Compiling means the process of translating
                                    the programing language to machine code. A computer does not understand directly the
                                    source code you write. A compiler is a program that reads your source code and
                                    converts it to a binary that your computer can execute. The instructions in that
                                    binary are harder to read for a human in comparison to the source code. Those
                                    instructions that the processor understands directly are called machine code. When
                                    the programs is compiled, you do not need any additional program to execute it
                                    besides the operating system. In contrast, when you run a python program, to execute
                                    it, you need the python interpreter.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Since C is so direct to the machine, people often say that it is like a portable
                                    Assembly. Assembly, as we will see later, is a language that is used to manipulate
                                    the instructions of the processor in your machine. Assembly changes depending on the
                                    kind of processor you are using. For example, Intel processors understand a
                                    different Assembly language than ARM processors. However, you could write the same
                                    program in C and it could work on both, because you can compile it either for ARM or
                                    for Intel.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In languages like python, we do not compile the program, because python has an
                                    interpreter that translates line by line when it is being executed. That makes it
                                    slower, by a fair amount. You can do an experiment by implementing a for loop that
                                    calculates something on each iteration, and compare the result between python and C,
                                    and you will note that a python loop takes much longer than a C loop that calculate
                                    the same.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Before proceeding to do more interesting programs, let&#8217;s stop to learn the data types
                            in C. In python, you can create a variables without specifying the data type. However, in C,
                            you need to specify it. These are fundamental data types in C:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ulist">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>char: It is the data type for allocating a single character. In most of the
                                    compilers, it takes only one byte. Note that we can store any number on it, it does
                                    not have to be an actual character. Remember that a character in a computer is a
                                    number too. Since it is one byte, it can represent 256 values. As you know already,
                                    one byte is made up of 8 bits. So, 2^8 is equal to 256.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>int: It is an integer type. We can place on it an integer number, but can be much
                                    bigger as the char, because an int uses four bytes. Therefore, we can place on it,
                                    roughly, four billion values (2^32).</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>float: This data type is used to store decimal numbers. In other words, numbers with
                                    a floating point value. They also take four bytes. But since they are decimals, is
                                    not that easy to show how many possible values stores. It is a finite number of
                                    possible values of course. But for now, just know it is used for storing numbers
                                    with decimals. Since we are on a computer, the precision is limited. A float can
                                    have at most 7 decimals!</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>double: It is used to store decimal numbers but with double precision, so it can have
                                    at most 15 decimals. It takes 8 bytes.</p>

                        <p>What is going on here? We did not even have a 7th position. Our array is actually only 5
                            positions in size. This is something bad. What is happening, is that C does not actually
                            have real arrays with size as other languages do. It is merely a chunk of memory. In this
                            case, our variable 'arr' is just a pointer to the first byte of that chunk of memory. When
                            we do, for example, arr[2], we are pointing to the first byte of the chunk of memory plus 8
                            bytes, because each integer has 4 bytes, so we move in memory to point to the place in which
                            is stored the third position. You will understand this better as you advance in binary
                            exploitation and understand how variables are placed in memory. For now, just know that C
                            allocates the memory needed to place a buffer, but does not have any control that prevents
                            you accessing the wrong place. In our example, 1695902208 is value from our program that is
                            8 bytes away from the spots in which or array should be stored, it could be other variable.
                            Many people claim that C does not have real arrays, because as you saw, it is just a chunk
                            of memory.</p>

                        <p>In C, you can create not only variables, but also pointers to variables. A pointer simply
                            stores the address in which a variable is located in memory. Now that you can read few lines
                            of C, it is better to explain a program using the comments on C to explain the things that
                            might be new to you. So, let&#8217;s take a look at the following program that illustrates
                            pointers in an easy manner. Pay close attention to the comments. Create a file, paste that
                            code, compile it, and run it as you already know how to. The following program might seem a
                            bit long, but it is because it has several prints so you can understand what is happening.
                            Is very easy to read. This is the program:</p>

                            very rough explanation, is that when you call a function, the computer needs to know how to
                            come back to continue executing the code that called it after the function finishes its
                            execution. The address of the piece of code that you should continue on after the function
                            call (you do not see this in the source code), is called the return address. Since the
                            program is not checking the boundaries of the input in the C program we made, you can
                            overwrite the place in which the return address is stored! Let’s understand that better so

                            <p>When we compile a C source code, this is converted to machine code also known as binary.
                                When a program is run, this machine code is placed in the code section. The code section
                                holds only machine code, not the source code we know from C for example. The machine
                                code is a set of instructions that the processor of a computer can understand. The
                                computer will execute the instructions sequentially and while doing that will access
                                other parts of memory to read data and output results.</p>

                                sections:</p>
                        </div>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Stack</p>
                                </li>

                            <p>In the data section, static and global variables are placed. This variables always exist
                                when the program is being run, in contrast to local variables that disappear when a
                                function finishes and returns the result.</p>

                            <p>In the heap is placed the memory allocated dynamically. For example, when you use malloc
                                in C to allocate a buffer, that buffer is allocated on the heap. It is called dynamic
                                allocation because the program allocates memory when is already running and executing
                                the particular instruction for malloc. In the code you write you can also decide to
                                deallocate a buffer of memory that you previously allocated. So, it is called dynamic
                                because the programmer can allocate it and deallocate a chunk of memory of a desired
                                size.</p>

                                addresses. What is a return address? When we call a function, the address of the next
                                instruction has to be stored somewhere so the program knows where to comeback after the
                                function is finished. We call this address the "return address". A function can be
                                called in different parts of a program, so this return address will be different
                                depending on where the program calls the function.</p>

                        <p>The execution of a program and its memory is controlled by processor registers, usually
                            called simply registers. These are a very small and fast kind of memory that is attached to
                            the processor. A register can store 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the processor. A processor
                            only has a few registers. Depending on the kind of processor, the registers might differ.
                            But we will take a look at the ones that are generic to most processors and will let us
                            understand later the most common binary exploits.</p>

                        <p>To see a real example in action we can use GDB, a software that allows us to see the
                            execution of each part of a programs and its memory step by step. This kind of software is
                            called a debugger. When a binary program is running and we debug it, we can see in detail
                            what the program is doing in memory by analyzing the <strong>Assembly</strong>. What is the
                            Assembly? It is a low level language that can be used to show what each instruction from the
                            machine code does. GDB can generate assembly from the machine code in memory while we are
                            debugging the program so we can easily see what the machine code is doing.</p>

                                    setting a breakpoint at a function it would pause at the beginning of the function?
                                    To be more precise, a breakpoint on a function is usually placed 4 bytes after the
                                    beginning of the machine code of what is considered the function. That’s why the
                                    "+4". Later we will understand why it’s done like this. The remaining part,
                                    "0x80c48348", is the actual content at the address "0x4005ce". That content is a
                                    part of the machine code of the "vuln()" function.</p>

                                    the following line to introduced machine code and assembly:</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>The left part is the address "0x400602 &lt;+56&gt;". After the address some spaces
                                    are shown, then in the middle we find the machine code, that in this case is "48 89
                                    c7". After some other spaces, we find the Assembly, which is "mov %rax,%rdi".
                                    Assembly is a low level language that can be directly mapped to the machine code.
                                    That’s why GDB can see some machine code in the memory and print for us the assembly
                                    that represents. A specific sequence of bytes in the machine code maps to an
                                    instruction of assembly. So, when a program is running and in memory is seen the
                                    sequence of bytes "48 89 c7" in the code segment, the computer knows that is some
                                    specific instruction and the processor has to do a specific action. Right now the
                                    intention is not to explain assembly in detail, but just for the sake of this
                                    example, know that "mov %rax,%rdi" moves the value of the register "rax" into the
                                    register "rdi". While the program is being executed by going forward in the code
                                    section of memory where the machine code is located, and it appears the sequence of
                                    bytes "48 89 c7", the processor knows that it has to copy the register "rax" into
                                    "rdi". Note that in the function, there are two parts in which appears the machine
                                    code "48 89 c7" and both have the same assembly.</p>

                                    Instruction Pointer. Then there is the &lt;+4&gt; which we already explained,
                                    followed by the machine code "48 83 c4 80" at the address 0x4005ce… Hold on, what is
                                    going on? A few paragraphs ago we said that the machine code at that address was "
                                    0x 80 c4 83 48" when we printed the Instruction Pointer using "x $rip". But now we
                                    say it is "48 83 c4 80". If you look closely, these are the same bytes but
                                    backwards. Let’s take advantage of this opportunity to explain "little endian".</p>

                                <p>This is the case only for numbers. Addresses are numbers. In an attack when you want
                                    to overwrite an address, you have to consider this and input the bytes of the
                                    address backwards so they are interpreted in the correct manner. Why do computers do
                                    this? There are some reasons and consequences. In fact there are also reasons for
                                    using "big endian" which is using the bytes without inverting them. One argument
                                    commonly given for supporting little endian, is that some operations are easier to
                                    do. For instance, if you have a number, let’s say 255 in decimal, it would be 0xff
                                    in hexadecimal. If the number is contained in a variable type that takes 4 bytes,
                                    for example an "int" in C, it would look like this in memory:</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>ff 00 00 00</p>

                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>Then, you want to cast it to a type that only takes two bytes, for example a "short"
                                    in C. In memory, you can leave the same value without having to move anything, and
                                    the "short" would look like this:</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>ff 00</p>

                                <p>Now, imagine that we were not using little endian. The type "int" would hold the

                                    that this is only for numbers. In a hypothetical situation if you want to place in

                    <p>We previously saw in binary exploitation how some registers work and how the memory of a program
                        is allocated. Once you get some idea of how to do basic binary exploits, to enter in a more
                        advance level it is useful to understand the assembly in more detail. There are several assembly
                        languages and they are exclusive to the processor architecture of a computer. Processor
                        architectures have specific instructions. For example, an Intel processor can execute different
                        instruction than an ARM processor, hence, the assembly language for ARM is different than the
                        one for Intel. To begin, we will be using Intel assembly just for the fact that Intel
                        architecture is widely used. The webshell, and your computer probably, have an Intel
                        architecture. Note that the AMD processors have the same architecture and instruction set as
                        Intel. Smartphones, in contrast to most laptops or desktops computers, generally have an ARM
                        processor.</p>

                    <p>Intel is CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer); that implies that it has much more instructions
                        than ARM which is RISC (Reduced Set Instruction Computer). However, we will only be exploring
                        some instruction in intel that are common and useful to know. It would be too dense to begin to
                        explain instructions independently. Instead, let’s make a program and begin to understand it.
                        Assembly is not easy to abstract at the beginning, but once you learn a few things, it becomes
                        very intuitive and it is possible to read assembly to understand the logic of a program in an
                        architecture you never saw before because it has similar patterns. Therefore, we encourage you
                        to keep trying on this part even if it seems not easy to grasp at the beginning.</p>

                        <p>We will show in this part, for reference, the most relevant registers from Intel Architecture
                            for an example of a program in assembly we will introduce. The Intel registers are broken
                            down in several categories. They include General Registers, Segment Registers, Index/Pointer
                            Registers, and Flags registers. For now, it is good to see the purpose of each of the
                            registers in two of those categories.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Note that in the General Registers, when we are using processor of 64 bits, the register name
                            begins with R. In a 32 bits processor, the register name begins with E, and in 16-bit
                            architecture, it does not have a prefix and the name is only two letters. For example, there
                            is a 16-bit register called AX. In 32 bits, we have the same register for the same purpose,
                            but it can hold 32 bits, and it is called EAX. In 64 bits, that same register is called RAX.
                            We can use a 16-bit or 32-bit register in a 64-bit architecture, but not the other way
                            around. Each register is conventionally used for some specific operations, but they can be
                            used for other purposes. These are the General Registers in 16, 32, 64 bits:
                            RAX,EAX,AX (Accumulator register): It is usually used to place the return value of a
                            function but can be used for other purposes.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>RBX,EBX,BX (Base register): Used as the base pointer for memory access. We subtract or add an
                            offset to the value of this register to access variables.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>RCX,ECX,CX (Counter register): Usually used as a loop counter.</p>

                        <p>Note that in a 64 bits program, the conventions can change. For example, in a 32-bit
                            architecture we generally pass the arguments of a function in the stack, while in 64-bit
                            programs we pass them in registers in many cases. For now, do not worry about those details.

                            create an variable that takes 4 bytes, the stack pointer moves 4 bytes to make room for that
                            new variable.</p>

                            a specific function. To access a local variable from a function, we take the address of the

                        <p>In AT&amp;T syntax, there are several differences. One of them that is notorious, is that you

                            position of arguments is different. Keep in mind this to prevent confusion. We will explain
                            the program using Intel syntax, following each line of the assembly code. Remember from the
                            binary exploitation section, that the hexadecimal number we observe at the left, for example
                            this ‘0x000055555555471a &lt;+0&gt;:’, is the memory address in which that instruction of

                        <p>We observe the instruction ‘push rbp’. As we know already, rbp is the base pointer, which is
                            a register used to keep track of the part of the stack in which the local variables of a
                            function begin to be stored. In this case, the current value of the rbp is pushed into the
                            stack, to be able to recover it later. This is an important part of a function that allow us
                            to keep the value of the base pointer from the previous function. For example, suppose you
                            have a function call inside another function, like in the following example in which we call
                            func2 from func1:</p>

                            memory address in which begins the stack frame of a function. For example, if the program is
                            currently executing func2, the three variables declared in func2, could look like the

                            positions from rbp, we would be pointing to var6. As you can see, accessing variables in
                            assembly is not complicated, we just need to subtract from rbp some positions to point to
                            the variable we want. However, we just have one register in the processor to keep the value
                            of the base pointer. So, what we do, is pushing into memory the value of the base pointer
                            from the previous function. That is the “rbp func1” that you see in the memory from the
                            previous image. We store the rbp from a previous function, as we store a local variable, to
                            be able to recover it later when we come back to func1 and be able to access the variable

                            Intel processor of 64 bits, a register is 8 bytes. So, when we do ‘push rbp’, it is

                            (stack pointer), is the operand at the right side, and rbp (base pointer) is the operand at
                            the left.
                            Such an assignment is done, because at the beginning of a function the stack pointer is
                            pointing to the beginning of the stack frame. When push variables in a function, the stack
                            pointer will move, because the stack pointer will be pointing always to the last variable

                        and 'blue' teams. Red teams are offensive, and they try to break into systems. Blue teams are
                        defensive, and they try to protect systems from attacks. Both teams are important, and they work
                        together to make sure that systems are secure.</p>

                        <p>One way vulnerabilities are reduced is through bug bounty programs, in which organizations

                        <p>Before publishing a vulnerability from a bug bounty program, or as a CVE, you should consider

                        <p>If a vulnerability is published before it is fixed, it could be exploited by malicious
                            actors. This could cause harm to people or organizations, as well as legal consequences for
                            the publisher. Each organization or program will have its own rules and preferences for how
                            to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Additionally, never hack into a system without permission, or attempt to go further than
                            requested. This is illegal, and it could similarly cause harm to people or organizations.
                            Bug bounty programs will define clear scopes for what is allowed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>If the organization does not respond to a disclosure of a security risk to them or their
                            users within a reasonable timeframe, there may be other options such as contacting a
                            governing agency. In the United States, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
                            (CISA) is a good place to start: <a

                        <p>Many hacking tools are web-based, and so they&#8217;ll work on any operating system that
                            allows you to run a web browser. A good example is <a href="https://crackstation.net"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrackStation</a> which allows anyone with an internet

                        <p>Another option is to use a remote server, which is a computer that you can access over the
                            internet. Typically, you&#8217;d own or rent this server, so you&#8217;d have more control
                            over how it&#8217;s used. This is a great way to run tools that require a lot of processing
                            power, or to run tools that you don&#8217;t want to run on your own computer due to space or
                            computing power limitations. Remote servers are often called and offered by 'cloud'
                            services, and they&#8217;re a great way to get started with hacking!</p>

                            interact with. Having a remote server, like an instance of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud
                            Platform, or Azure, is unique in that you can choose the tools that are installed, the

                        <p>Virtual machines (VM) are a great way to run tools that require a specific operating system,
                            or to run multiple operating systems at once. These can be run locally, or on a remote

                        <p>You might sometimes hear VMs referred to as a 'box' because anything inside of one tends to
                            stay inside. You can treat a VM as if it were a separate computer - even if it&#8217;s
                            sharing hardware locally or with your remote server!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>For example, if you use a Windows computer, you can run a virtual machine with a distro of
                            Linux to run Linux tools. You can also configure your virtual machine to be created in a
                            certain way, and then reset or share that state with others! <a href="https://podman.io/"

                            teams have effectively identical environments so collaboration is easy. Since hacking can
                            sometimes be very dependent on the version of a target&#8217;s hardware or software, being
                            able to practice on an exact copy is helpful. For the same reason, this is why downloading
                            security updates for your software is a good idea! Cyber teams around the world work to
                            'patch' problems and publish fixes as quickly as they can.</p>

                            computer, most malware will be contained inside it. If you run into any issues, you can

                        <p>In industry, companies often require their employees to use a company VPN to access their
                            internal network from outside the office. Just like how VPNs can protect an
                            individual&#8217;s data, they can protect a company&#8217;s sensitive information too!
                            Without a VPN, employees working remotely may be vulnerable to their credentials being
                            stolen.</p>

                            VPN, use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication whenever possible. That way, even
                            if an adversary were to steal your password from one service, they would need others in

                    <p>Version control is a way for developers to 'time-travel' by allowing them to save their files and
                        return to them at any point. For example, you may start making changes to your Python code, and
                        find that suddenly it doesn&#8217;t work anymore! Git would allow you to go back to a version of
                        your code that does work.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>When working with teams of programmers or hackers, version control allows you to compare
                        differences, or diffs, of each file and then 'merge' your progress together. This way, multiple
                        people can work on the same problem without undoing each other&#8217;s progress!</p>

                    <p>Along with Git, other Version Control Systems (VCS) include Subversion (SVN), Sapling, and Piper.
                        Many large companies will develop or modify their VCS to fit their needs, though the basic
                        principles remain the same. With tens of thousands of employees working on the same projects,
                        some form of version control is a necessity for professionals to get work done.</p>

                        interchangeably. However, Git and GitHub are less similar. Git is a VCS or SCM, while GitHub is
                        web-based platform for development and collaboration that uses Git. We&#8217;ll talk more about

                        <p>Above is an example of a branching structure. Each commit is numbered with a prefix 'C', and
                            a branch has been created to work on a feature. 'C4' is a snapshot, or check point, of the
                            most progress on the master, or main, branch. 'C5' with commit ID "iss53" is a snapshot of
                            the most progress done for the feature. Note how 'C5' contains 'C0', 'C1', 'C2', and 'C3'
                            while 'C4' only contains 'C0', 'C1', and 'C2'.</p>

                        <p>When merging 'C5' into the main branch at 'C2', the commit history of 'C5' will be merged as
                            well. If <code>$ git log</code> were to be run afterward, it would show a path from commit
                            'C4' to 'C5' to 'C3' to 'C2' to 'C1' and finally to the initial commit 'C0'.</p>

                    <div id="git-merging" class="paragraph">
                        <p>If you&#8217;re working with a 'remote' repository, such as one on GitHub, you can 'pull' or
                            'fetch' changes from the remote repository with <code>git pull</code>. This will download
                            any changes from the remote repository and merge them with your current branch. This is
                            known as 'fast-forwarding' because the changes are simply added to the end of your
                            branch&#8217;s commit history. It&#8217;s important to do this regularly to avoid merge
                            conflicts later!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>A merge conflict is when two branches have changes on the same line. This can happen when
                            you&#8217;re working on your local machine or personal branch, and changes are made to the
                            original file before you merge back in. Fetching the latest changes helps ensure that any
                            differences are minimal. Ideally, conflicts can also be avoided by working on different
                            files or different lines of code on each branch.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>However, if you do run into a merge conflict, Git will show you the difference between the
                            file on each branch and ask what you&#8217;d like to keep. You can then use a text editor to
                            delete the other change, or splice the changes together.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>The start of the conflict is marked with <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code>, and
                            the end of the conflict is marked with
                            <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;branch name&gt;</code>. Somewhere in the middle will
                            be a <code>=======</code> which marks the division between the lines in each branch.
